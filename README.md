This repository includes slides, notes and code demonstrations from Glacier and Ice Sheet Dynamics (EAS 4803/8803) at Georgia Tech, a combined undergrad/grad survey course on modern glaciology. Most recently (Spring 2021) this course was co-taught with Prof. Winnie Chu.

The demo scripts in this repository include in-class demonstrations of certain concepts or numerical models. Where available, I have included relevant board lecture notes that explain the model or concept being demonstrated in the lectures. I am in the process of converting all demos to Jupyter notebooks and will endevor to store them here, though in the mean time, the original MATLAB versions of demos are here.
