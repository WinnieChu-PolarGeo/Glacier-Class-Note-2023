This repository includes slides, notes and code demonstrations from Glacier and Ice Sheet Dynamics (EAS 4803/8803) at Georgia Tech, a combined undergrad/grad survey course on modern glaciology. Most recently (Spring 2021) this course was co-taught with Prof. Winnie Chu.

The demo scripts in this repository include in-class demonstrations of certain concepts or numerical models. Where available, I have included relevant board lecture notes that explain the model or concept being demonstrated in the lectures. I am in the process of converting all demos to Jupyter notebooks and will endevor to store them here, though in the mean time, the original MATLAB versions of demos are here.

All the code and lecture notes used here are available for public use and modification, though I would ask that re-use preserves a credit the original authors (some of these are adapted from others who deserve due credit).
